it is painless and happens occasionally. Mostly scrotum is itchy 
ChatGPT said:
Thanks ‚Äî that detail helps a lot.

Based on what you‚Äôve said ‚Äî occasional, painless, bubble-like spots that bleed when they break, mostly on the scrotum, with itchiness ‚Äî here‚Äôs the most likely explanation:

üü£ Most Likely: Angiokeratomas of the Scrotum
These are:

Small, dark red to purple raised spots

Often described as ‚Äúblood blisters‚Äù

Usually painless

Can itch (especially if the area is sweaty or irritated)

Tend to bleed easily if scratched or rubbed

Harmless, but can be alarming due to bleeding

üí° Why they happen: Dilated blood vessels in the skin, often due to aging, friction, heat, or increased pressure in veins (like varicoceles).

üü† Other Possibilities (Less Likely, but Possible)
1. Folliculitis
Infected hair follicles from shaving, sweating, or bacteria

Would look more like pimples or small red bumps

Often tender or itchy, and may contain pus or blood

2. Fungal Infection ("jock itch")
Causes itchiness, redness, or peeling in groin/scrotum

Usually doesn‚Äôt cause bleeding bumps, but scratching could irritate the skin enough to create small sores or bleeding

3. Scrotal eczema or dermatitis
Itchy, irritated skin that may crack or form small blisters

Not usually blood-filled, but scratching can break the skin

‚úÖ What You Can Do
To manage itchiness and prevent bleeding spots:
Avoid scratching ‚Äî it worsens irritation and can cause bleeding

Wear loose, breathable underwear (e.g., 100% cotton)

Keep the area clean and dry

After showering, dry gently with a towel (no rubbing)

Use anti-fungal powder (like clotrimazole) if there‚Äôs moisture or odor

Try unscented moisturizer or petroleum jelly for dryness or irritation

Optional: Over-the-counter treatments
Hydrocortisone 1% cream ‚Äî for itch (short-term use only)

Clotrimazole cream ‚Äî if you suspect a fungal cause (itch + rash)

üö© When to See a Doctor
You likely don‚Äôt need urgent care, but see a dermatologist or urologist if:

The bleeding spots increase in number or size

You get repeated bleeding, itching, or discomfort

You notice swelling, discharge, or pain

You‚Äôre unsure whether it's an infection or skin condition

They can confirm angiokeratomas or rule out anything else with just a visual exam.

üîç TL;DR
You‚Äôre most likely dealing with angiokeratomas ‚Äî harmless blood vessel spots ‚Äî combined with itchy skin (possibly from sweat, friction, or mild fungal irritation). Manage it with better hygiene, avoid scratching, and use a powder or cream if needed.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to identify it visually (I can guide you through spotting differences), or want a list of products that help.

You said:
One more thing is when this is not there, scrotum area is most of the time itchy.
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the follow-up ‚Äî this is an important clue.

If your scrotum is frequently itchy, even when there are no visible bumps or bleeding, and it‚Äôs been happening for a while, then something chronic and irritating is likely going on.

üîç Most Likely Cause of Ongoing Itch: Chronic Irritation + Moisture
üü† Possibilities:
1. Fungal Infection (Tinea Cruris, aka "Jock Itch")
Very common in men, especially in warm or humid climates

Caused by fungus that thrives in moist, sweaty areas

Symptoms:

Persistent itch

May or may not have visible rash

Sometimes scaly, reddish, or with slightly darker skin

Often extends to groin folds, thighs, or buttocks

Scratching can cause minor bleeding, irritation, or worsen fungal spread

2. Intertrigo
Skin irritation caused by friction + moisture (sweat, tight clothing)

Common in groin/scrotal area

May not always look like a rash

Can become secondarily infected with bacteria or yeast

Itch and redness are common

3. Contact Dermatitis / Allergic Reaction
Triggered by:

Soaps, detergents, fabric softeners

Body washes, deodorants, or scented products

Latex (e.g., in condoms or underwear waistbands)

Itch may be the only symptom ‚Äî skin may appear normal or slightly red

4. Scrotal Eczema (aka Chronic Scrotal Dermatitis)
A non-infectious skin condition affecting the scrotum

Skin feels itchy, dry, or leathery over time

Can be worsened by stress, heat, or irritants

‚úÖ What You Can Do
üß¥ 1. Keep Area Clean, Dry, and Cool
Shower daily, especially after sweating

Dry the scrotum thoroughly (pat gently, no rubbing)

Change underwear at least once a day (more if sweating)

Use loose-fitting cotton underwear

üåø 2. Use Anti-Fungal or Soothing Creams
Try Clotrimazole 1% cream twice daily (OTC antifungal)

If itchy, you can also use Hydrocortisone 1% cream (short-term, 5‚Äì7 days max)

For moisture: use antifungal powder like Zeasorb AF or Gold Bond Medicated

üö´ 3. Avoid Triggers
Stop using scented soaps or lotions on your groin

Switch to gentle, hypoallergenic soap (e.g., Dove Sensitive, Cetaphil)

Avoid shaving the area unless necessary (irritates skin)

Avoid tight underwear or synthetic fabrics

üö© When to See a Doctor
It‚Äôs been going on for weeks/months and doesn‚Äôt improve

Creams or powders aren‚Äôt helping

You see new rashes, sores, discharge, or pain

The itch interferes with sleep or daily life

A dermatologist can take a quick look and possibly do a skin scraping to check for fungus or other causes. Treatment may include a prescription-strength antifungal or steroid cream.

üß† Final Thoughts
Your symptoms point strongly to chronic fungal irritation or moisture/friction dermatitis ‚Äî both are very common, very treatable, and often go unnoticed until symptoms get worse (like bleeding or itching). The good news is: with some changes in hygiene and maybe an antifungal cream, you‚Äôll likely see big improvement.

Product Highlights
Candid Dusting Powder (antifungal)
‚Ä¢ An antifungal dusting powder available in India‚Äîhelps absorb moisture and combat fungal overgrowth that causes jock itch (tinea cruris), a common cause of scrotal itching.

Cutisoft Cream (hydrocortisone‚ÄØ1‚ÄØ%)
‚Ä¢ A mild, over-the-counter topical steroid cream. Useful for short-term relief of persistent itching or irritation, but should only be used sparingly and briefly.

Safety and Usage Guidance
1. Antifungal Powder (e.g., Candid Dusting Powder)
Fungal infections like jock itch thrive in warm, moist folds‚Äîscrotal itching often stems from this.

Antifungal powders (e.g., miconazole, clotrimazole) help by both treating fungus and absorbing moisture

.

Regular use can reduce itch, prevent recurrence, and avoid irritation from scratching.

2. Low-Strength Hydrocortisone Cream (e.g., Cutisoft 1%)
Can be used for short-term relief when itching is severe, but limited to a few days.

The scrotal skin is particularly thin and absorbent, which increases risk of side effects like thinning, discoloration, stretch marks, or increased susceptibility to infections

Suggested Routine
Daily Hygiene

Wash gently with mild, fragrance-free soap.

Pat dry gently‚Äîavoid rubbing.

Wear loose cotton underwear and change daily (or more often if sweating).

Apply the Antifungal Powder

After drying, dust the scrotal area lightly each morning.

Reapply after activities that cause sweating or moisture.

Use Hydrocortisone Cream Only as Needed

If itching becomes intense and disrupts sleep or comfort, apply a thin layer of hydrocortisone 1% for up to 5‚Äì7 consecutive days, then stop.

Monitor the area. If symptoms recur quickly or persist, consult a doctor rather than continuing steroid use.

Where to Seek Further Help
If symptoms persist despite this routine.

If you notice sores, discharge, swelling, or new rashes.

A dermatologist or urologist can confirm whether it's a fungal rash, dermatitis, or something else‚Äîsometimes a quick visual exam or skin scrape is sufficient.

Real-World Experiences (From Community Advice)
Some users online have had mixed results with hydrocortisone on scrotal skin:

‚ÄúDermatologists say avoid steroid creams on RSS, it can exacerbate the issue.‚Äù 
Reddit

‚ÄúI used 1% hydrocortisone combo antifungal on my scrotum ‚Ä¶ it thinned the skin. More visible blood vessels now.‚Äù 
Reddit

These accounts reinforce the advice to use steroids cautiously and cautiously limit duration.

You said:
I have used some sort of paste form from candid, which seems to reduce itching when applied for 4 or 5 days. Then itching stops. But after a month or so again it starts itching
ChatGPT said:
Thanks ‚Äî that‚Äôs a very helpful update.

What you're describing is a common pattern with fungal infections, especially jock itch (tinea cruris) or chronic fungal irritation in the groin/scrotum area:

üîÅ Pattern You're Experiencing:
You apply Candid paste/cream (probably Candid B or Candid cream, containing clotrimazole ¬± beclomethasone).

Itching stops in 4‚Äì5 days.

You stop using it.

After a few weeks, itching returns.

üîÑ This is classic incomplete treatment of a fungal infection, possibly worsened by steroid-containing creams.

üö® Important: If You're Using Candid B (Clotrimazole + Beclomethasone)
Candid B contains:

Clotrimazole: Antifungal (good)

Beclomethasone: A potent steroid (not ideal for scrotal skin)

Why that's a problem:
The steroid quickly reduces itching and inflammation, giving fast relief.

But it can:

Suppress your immune response, allowing fungus to survive under the skin

Cause thinning of the skin

Lead to recurrent or worse fungal infections

Over time, make skin dependent and harder to treat

This is known as ‚ÄúTinea incognito‚Äù ‚Äî a fungal infection made worse or hidden by steroid use.

‚úÖ What You Should Do Now
1. Switch to a Pure Antifungal (No Steroid)
Use something like:

Candid Cream (just Clotrimazole 1%)

Alternatives: Luliconazole (Lulicon) or Terbinafine (Lamisil) cream

üïí Apply twice daily for at least 2‚Äì4 weeks, even after the itching stops.
Fungal infections can persist in the skin even when symptoms go away ‚Äî stopping too soon leads to recurrence.

2. Use Antifungal Powder Daily
Candid Dusting Powder or Absorbent antifungal powder (e.g., Clotrimazole powder)

Keeps the area dry and inhibits fungal regrowth

Use after bathing and before bed.

3. Avoid Using Candid B (or any cream with steroids)
Unless specifically prescribed by a doctor for a diagnosed skin condition

These creams give fast relief but lead to chronic, recurring fungal issues when used repeatedly on groin or scrotum

üßº Lifestyle Tips (Important for Prevention)
Tip	Why
Wear loose cotton underwear	Reduces moisture and friction
Change clothes after sweating	Prevents fungal overgrowth
Dry groin thoroughly after bathing	Fungi love moist skin
Avoid talcum powder (use antifungal instead)	Talcum can trap moisture
üß† Summary
You likely have recurrent fungal infection.

You're seeing short-term relief with steroid-antifungal mix (Candid B), but it's not curing the infection ‚Äî just masking it.

Switch to a pure antifungal cream (no steroid), use for 2‚Äì4 weeks, and add antifungal powder daily.

Avoid steroids unless prescribed ‚Äî they worsen chronic fungal conditions in this area.

üîë Important Tips
Complete the full course of antifungal cream ‚Äî fungal infections can hide deep in skin layers, and stopping early causes recurrence.

Avoid scratching to prevent skin damage and bleeding.

Change underwear daily and after sweating.

Keep the area cool and dry ‚Äî moisture encourages fungal growth.

Avoid scented soaps, deodorants, or harsh chemicals on the groin.

If symptoms persist despite this treatment, or if you develop sores, swelling, pain, or discharge, see a healthcare professional for further evaluation.

Would you like help finding online stores or local pharmacies where you can get these products? Or do you want tips on how to apply the cream and powder correctly?

Got it! Here's the best practical combo for your situation, balancing effectiveness, availability, and gentleness on sensitive skin:

üõÅ Best Combination
1. Bath Soap / Cleanser
Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser

Mild, fragrance-free, non-irritating

Good for sensitive skin and reduces irritation caused by harsh soaps

Helps keep area clean without drying it out

2. Antifungal Cream
Candid Cream (Clotrimazole 1%)

Proven antifungal

Widely available and affordable

Use twice daily for 2‚Äì4 weeks, even if symptoms improve earlier

3. Antifungal Powder
Candid Dusting Powder (Clotrimazole powder)
