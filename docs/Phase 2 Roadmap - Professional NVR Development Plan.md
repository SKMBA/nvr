# Phase 2 Roadmap - Professional NVR Development Plan

## Executive Summary

Following the successful completion of **Phase 1** (multiprocess supervisor architecture, isolated camera workers, and robust recording system), **Phase 2** focuses on delivering professional user interfaces that meet commercial NVR standards. The phase is strategically split into two subphases to prioritize reliable on-site operations before expanding to remote web-based access.

**Strategic Decision:** Local UI development precedes Web UI to ensure:
- Professional on-site operator experience matching commercial NVR systems
- Offline-capable operations during network outages
- Low-latency, hardware-accelerated multi-camera monitoring
- Stable foundation for subsequent web-based remote access features

## Phase 1 Foundation Review
